QPGE: the Quantum Python Game Engine
====================================

QPGE is a straightforward object-oriented interactive fiction game engine to demonstrate quantum algorithms for agent-based AI pathfinding, decisions, and heuristics.

As it is powered by D-Wave's Python Pack, it is only enjoyable to registered D-Wave developers (registration for the developer portal has been closed for quite some time).

System Requirements
-------------------

* Linux x86_64 or Windows
* Python 2.7
* NumPy
* D-Wave Python Pack 1.4.0

Note: D-Wave's Python Pack was never released for OS X or Python 3.  Sorry.
